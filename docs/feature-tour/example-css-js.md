# Example CSS JS

When using the [Single-line comment form](/craft-plugins/comments/docs/developers/template-reference#single-line-comment-form), you'll be presented with a unstyled list of comments and commenting form - not ideal. This is however intentional, as we don't believe we should force any style or functionality on your use of Comments.

However, we've provided some sample [CSS](https://github.com/verbb/comments/blob/craft-2/examples/comments-style.css) and minimal [JS](https://github.com/verbb/comments/blob/craft-2/examples/standard/standard.html#L17) to get started with.

The HTML code generated by the Single-line comment form tag is based largely on Bootstrap, and is easily stylable through the many classes provided. Have a look at [comments.html](https://github.com/verbb/comments/blob/craft-2/comments/templates/_forms/templates) for the templating code used.

If you wish to customise this form, consult the [Template Overrides](/craft-plugins/comments/docs/feature-tour/template-overrides) section.

## Full examples

To get you started, we've provided two fully functional, styled examples: - [Non-Ajax](https://github.com/verbb/comments/blob/craft-2/examples/standard) - [Ajax](https://github.com/verbb/comments/blob/craft-2/examples/ajax)
